### Recent activity

- [**Sign a
  petition**](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/reject-the-trump-administrations-compact-for-academic-excellence-in-higher-education?source=direct_link&)
  urging UW-Madison to reject the Trump administration's "compact".
  A group of faculty are proposing a faculty senate resolution
  opposing the contract, but the next faculty senate meeting is Nov 3,
  which is after the Trump administration's Oct 20 deadline.

- The Executive Committee of the UW-Madison chapter of the AAUP, together
with the boards of [WUU](https://wuu.info),
[UFAS](https://ufas223.org), and [TAA](https://taa-madison.org), wrote
a [letter to UW-Madison Chancellor Mnookin and UW
System President Rothman](news.html) expressing concerns about campus free speech.
(See [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5UETBgVnaxeeNx9Z8DFfELwnTArV5NImF_iqJiYy_o/edit?tab=t.0)
and [pdf](assets/free_speech_letter_to_Mnookin_Rothman.pdf).)


### Recent concerns

- The Trump administration has sent demands to nine schools, that they
  agree to a ["compact"](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/trump-college-funding.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rU8.cmw_.cJ9eFeKx7VIh&smid=url-share) in exchange for federal research funds.
  See [AAUP's
  response](https://www.aaup.org/news/universities-must-reject-trump-admin-loyalty-oath-compacts):
  Universities must reject "Loyalty Oath" compacts. (The "compact" has
  now been extended to all universities, with administrators having
  until Oct 20 to respond.)

- The UW System administration is introducing a [new policy on core
  general education requirements](https://www.wisconsin.edu/act-15-cger/) in response to
  [Act 15 Section 134](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/related/acts/15/134), and
  there are concerns about the implications for ethnic studies
  requirements at UW-Madison and other campuses. Comments must be
  [submitted
  online](https://www.wisconsin.edu/regents/draft-policy-proposals-for-comment/)
  by Wednesday, 15 Oct 2025..

- UW System administration also has a
  [workgroup](https://www.wisconsin.edu/act-15-workload/) working on
  the new teaching workload requirements from
  [Act 15 Section 137](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/related/acts/15/137).
